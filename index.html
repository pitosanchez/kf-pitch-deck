                Andrew Luu's journey began with a life-saving kidney transplant
                from his mother at age 13â€”an act that fueled his lifelong
                commitment to service and purpose. Initially launching a career
                in corporate finance, Andrew soon pivoted toward mission-driven
                work, co-founding a mentorship program and later a social
                enterprise incubator. His path has spanned managing artists,
                producing films, interning on Capitol Hill, and contributing to
                a successful e-bike startup. He later led community engagement
                efforts at Experian's CSR team and managed international affairs
                programs in the federal government. Deeply committed to local
                service, Andrew also volunteered with his local fire department
                and served on its Board of Trustees. He holds degrees in
                Biological Sciences and Economics from UC Irvine and an MBA from
                Columbia University.

              <p>
                Robert Sanchez is a kidney transplant recipient, community
                leader, and founder of The Jentosy Projectâ€”an initiative focused
                on expanding access to living kidney donation in underserved
                communities. His journey into advocacy began at 18, when he was
                sentenced under the harsh Rockefeller Drug Laws despite no prior
                record or direct involvement in drug activity. During his
                15-year incarceration, Robert earned a Bachelor's in Behavioral
                Science and a Master's in Theology, and co-founded
                Rehabilitation Through The Arts (RTA), now a statewide program
                featured in the 2024 A24 film Sing Sing. After his release,
                Robert pursued social work studies until kidney failure halted
                his path. He has survived two kidney transplants, the latest in
                2020, and turned his lived experience into a mission to help
                others navigate the transplant system. Based in NYC, Robert is
                also a poet, illustrator, and sports fan, committed to healing
                through both advocacy and art.

            <h2>ABOUT KIDNEY FORWARD</h2>
            <p>
              Kidney Forward was founded in 2024 by Andrew Luu, shaped by his
              own journey with chronic kidney disease. After receiving a kidney
              from his mother at 13, Andrew found himself in need of another
              transplant by 2020. When family members who initially offered to
              donate backed out, he was placed on the waitlist in California â€”
              where the average wait is 8 to 10 years. That experience revealed
              a deeper crisis: the urgent need for more awareness and access to
              living kidney donation.
            </p>
            <p>
              TToday, Kidney Forward is on a mission to eliminate transplant
              waitlists by activating a national network of living kidney
              donors. With 18 people dying every day waiting for a kidney, our
              work is urgent. We support patients directly, helping them find
              donors, improving health outcomes, and lowering long-term
              healthcare costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2024, Robert Sanchez joined as Director of the Jentosy Project,
              bringing years of lived experience and advocacy leadership. His
              focus on reaching underserved communities strengthens our
              commitment to equity and ensures that no one is left behind in the
              fight for a second chance at life.

              At Kidney Forward, we recognize your vital role as leaders,
              medical experts, and advocates in kidney health. Your support and
              guidance are instrumental in transforming our vision into tangible
              outcomes. Today, we invite you to partner with us, leveraging your
              expertise, insights, and leadership to enhance our efforts in

            <p>
              Currently, over 90,000 individuals in the United States urgently
              await a kidney transplant, and each day represents both a
              challenge and an opportunity. With your collaboration, Kidney
              Forward can amplify its impact, fostering innovative education
              programs, strategic partnerships, and meaningful policy
              advancements.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are seeking your supportâ€”not only as advisors and mentors but
              also as key partners who can help mobilize the resources essential
              to drive this mission forward. Whether through seed funding,
              grants, or strategic investments, financial contributions can
              enable groundbreaking initiatives, saving countless lives and
              transforming communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, we can inspire hope, deliver lifesaving change, and
              redefine the future of kidney transplantation in America.
