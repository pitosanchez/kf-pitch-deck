              </h2>
              <p>
                At Kidney Forward, our goal is to inspire individuals nationwide
                to consider donating a kidney, a powerful act that can save
                lives. Every year, over 100,000 people in the United States
                await kidney transplants, with many unable to receive one due to
                the limited availability of kidneys. Through compelling
                advocacy, innovative education, and strong community engagement,
                Kidney Forward aims to foster widespread awareness and motivate
                greater participation in live kidney donation. We strive to
                build supportive communities and equip individuals with the
                knowledge and resources they need, ultimately transforming lives
                through the gift of kidney donation.

              <h2>Andrew's Journey</h2>
              <p>
                A personal story of resilience and hope in the face of kidney
                disease, inspiring others to take control of their health
                journey. After receiving a kidney donation from his mother at
                just 13 years old, Andrew Luu committed himself to maximizing
                the opportunity afforded by his renewed health. Driven by
                gratitude and a passion for meaningful impact, he pursued a life
                dedicated to public service and purposeful endeavors. Andrew
                began his professional journey in corporate finance but quickly
                realized it lacked the fulfillment he had experienced running a
                mentorship program he co-founded during his college years.
                Deciding to shift gears, Andrew co-founded a social enterprise
                incubator. Over the next several years, he took on diverse
                roles, including managing a rapper, producing a feature film,
                interning for a Congressman, and contributing to the early
                stages of a start-up that evolved into a prominent e-bike brand.
                His dedication to community impact led him back to the nonprofit
                sector, joining Experian's Corporate Social Responsibility team.
                There, Andrew effectively managed corporate matching programs
                and spearheaded volunteer initiatives. He subsequently
                transitioned to the federal government, where he managed various
                international affairs programs. Committed to serving his local
                community, Andrew volunteered and served on the Board of
                Trustees for a local fire department in Virginia. He was also a
                member of the Recruitment and Retention Committee for the
                Fairfax County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association. Andrew
                holds degrees in Biological Sciences and Economics from the
                University of California, Irvine, and earned his MBA from
                Columbia University.

              <h2>Robert's Experience</h2>
              <p>
                Robert joined Kidney Forward following the establishment of his
                own nonprofit initiative. Driven by his personal journey with
                chronic kidney disease and extensive firsthand experience
                navigating the complexities of organ transplantation, Robert is
                committed to enhancing access to kidney transplants and
                promoting living kidney donation. Robert's path to advocacy
                began unexpectedly at age 18, when he was arrested in connection
                with drugs found in a friend's apartment. Despite having no
                prior criminal record, no drugs on his person, and no recorded
                involvement in drug sales, he was sentenced under the severe
                Rockefeller Drug Laws to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15
                years to life. During his incarceration, Robert pursued
                education as a tool for empowerment, earning a Bachelor's degree
                in Behavioral Science and a Master's degree in Theology from the
                New York Theological Seminary. He also co-founded Rehabilitation
                Through The Arts (RTA), a groundbreaking program offering
                incarcerated individuals avenues for artistic and creative
                expression. Now operating for over 25 years across multiple
                prisons in New York State, RTA's transformative impact inspired
                the 2024 A24 feature film, "Sing Sing." Upon his release, Robert
                pursued further education in clinical social work at the
                Silberman School of Social Work. However, kidney failure forced
                him to pause his studies. Diagnosed with chronic kidney disease
                in 2007, Robert began dialysis immediately. A donated kidney
                from a friend in 2009 lasted five years before failing,
                requiring another prolonged period of dialysis. Finally, in
                October 2020, Robert received his second kidney transplant.
                Motivated by these profound healthcare challenges, Robert
                founded The Jentosy Project, dedicated to increasing living
                donor matches within underserved communities and assisting
                individuals in navigating the organ transplant process. Robert
                currently resides in New York City, where he channels his
                creativity as a poet, illustrator, and painter. He enjoys
                sports, music, and spending meaningful time with friends.

          <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-6">
            <h2>ABOUT KIDNEY FORWARD</h2>
            <p>
              Founded in 2024 by Andrew Luu, Kidney Forward is driven by deeply
              personal experiences with chronic kidney disease and the
              complexities surrounding kidney transplantation. Andrew received
              his first kidney transplant at age 13 from his mother—a gift that
              allowed him to experience two decades of vibrant life. However, by
              2020, Andrew's kidney function had deteriorated significantly,
              initiating the difficult process of seeking another transplant.
              Encouraged by his extended family's commitment to become living
              donors, Andrew relocated back to Southern California after
              spending nearly a decade living on the East Coast and overseas.
              During this challenging transition, he worked full-time and
              pursued a Master's degree, strategically positioning himself for
              reliable health insurance coverage in anticipation of his
              declining health. Tragically, when the time came, Andrew’s family
              withdrew their support, leaving him on a waitlist in California, a
              state where the average wait for a deceased donor kidney ranges
              from eight to ten years. This painful setback reinforced Andrew’s
              understanding of living with a chronic, invisible illness—the
              isolation, the disappointment, and the frustration of navigating a
              world often unaware of its privilege of health. Today, Kidney
              Forward is passionately committed to eliminating kidney transplant
              waitlists by activating living kidney donors at scale. With 18
              people dying each day in the United States waiting for a kidney
              from a deceased donor, our goal is urgent and clear: mobilize
              latent living donors to ensure no one feels abandoned or alone in
              their journey towards transplant. What sets Kidney Forward apart
              is our proactive, hands-on approach. While educational resources
              are essential, we actively participate in the process, helping
              individuals identify and connect with potential living donors.
              This unique participatory model empowers patients and
              significantly improves patient outcomes, survival rates, and
              reduces healthcare costs for patients, families, and taxpayers. In
              2024, Robert Sanchez joined Kidney Forward, bringing with him
              extensive experience in advocacy and community engagement,
              particularly within underserved communities. Robert's own
              experience as a kidney transplant recipient and his leadership
              through initiatives like The Jentosy Project significantly enhance
              Kidney Forward’s mission by addressing disparities and promoting
              equitable access to transplants for all, irrespective of their
              background. Kidney Forward remains deeply engaged with each
              patient's health journey, advocating, supporting, and actively
              participating to ensure no one navigates this critical process
              alone. Andrew’s own journey, marked by both setbacks and
              resilience, inspires Kidney Forward’s unwavering commitment to
              ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to experience life to
              its fullest.
